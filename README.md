# gadgetOS

**An AI-Driven Operating System for the Future**

---

## 🧠 Project Description

**gadgetOS** is an innovative, AI-based operating system that integrates machine learning and artificial intelligence directly into the core of the OS to revolutionize user experience, system performance, and automation. Developed with cutting-edge technologies like Rust, Python, and OpenAI APIs, gadgetOS brings intelligent features like adaptive UIs, predictive task management, real-time threat detection, and natural language voice control to the OS layer.

This operating system is designed to **learn from user behavior**, adapt dynamically to changing needs, and **optimize resource allocation**, offering a futuristic, responsive, and highly secure environment for both personal and enterprise use.
